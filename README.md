## Code is Art 

Im a self thought developer with a bacelor degree in Computer Science. 
i rather reinvent the wheel then using a faulty one. 
i hate long code files and stupid solutions, i love simplicity and that requires iterations of your solution

### a note for "professional" developers 
I think yall should learn math first before code as you learn problem solving,  
far too many people i have met that doesnt really have great understanding in computers and you get too stuck to become a tool for a company.

### a note for beginners 
make sure you enjoy what you do and coding can become one of your biggest strengths 

### a note to myself 
life doesnt have to be so hard. 

### a note to recruiters 
if i didnt reach out to you or if you aint from the gaming industry i will most likely turn you down, but try anyway!

### my favorite languages 
- Javascript 
- css 

### my favorite area 
collision detection + reaponse algorithms 

### web-components 
this project of mine is worth talking about. 
it is becoming my little baby, something i will be able to reuse for whatever JS project i want, its not just a web-component library but rather a life-cycle/ecosystem
for javascript projects. The key goal is 0-dependency, currently there's dev-dependency on 
- esbuild
- typescript
- tslib
- sass
- node-html-parser 
- chokidar

It is a monorepo setup that allows you to create new packages (which can be controlled by modifying some template)
secondly this is some sort of framework to build web components, (again you can also just build classes if you prefer) 
but these web components have simpel way to deal with viewing and testing. each package structure tries to follow very standard web structure 
it uploads to npmjs given that you have nom_token peovided in your repo. 

everything is mostly self coded so you will see a lot of bash files. which could be intimidating at first but then you realise that what you see is exactly what you get.
some solutions will be changed but I try always to make solutions just smarter but also that does complex stuff. 
i feel i could hold several talks about my project but i dont have the time for that. i really would like to have some guided view on how to fully use it and some of the very smart component soltions i have made but again no time. 
if you feel brave enough to actually try it out I would love some feedback, if any questions I would love to help.
